# Nethereum Blazor

The Nethereum Blazor application is a Wasm browser based light blockchain explorer and wallet.

The aim of this application is to provide another wallet / client reference for the final goal of providing a reusable common front end framework and libraries targetting all Dekstops (WinForms, Xamarin.Forms, Avalonia for Windows, Mac, Linux), Mobile (Android and iOS using Xamarin.Forms), Browser SPA (Blazor this example, Uno) and gaming / vr engines (Unity3d)
